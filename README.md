# A Short Story

20 years ago, I was at the keyboard section of Yodobashi Camera in Tokyo. After days of testing keyboards on display, I got my first premium mechanical keyboard. A Filco with cherry brown switches. Reviews were raving, and
I used the thing for 20 years. No complaints. 

Then recently, after upgrading to an Evangelion themed custom PC, I grabbed the matching ASUS EVA Strix Scope keyboard. A beautiful, fully lit, full-sized mechanical keyboard. A marvel of ASUS engineering, with raving reviewes, that matched my setup perfectly. 

Except, it was too big, too clicky, and a bit too stiff. It wasn't it.

So being bored with how I interfaced my computer, and being old enough to think this could be my last chance to switch for health benefits, I arrived at the ZSA Voyager. Another fully lit marvel backed by raving reviews. Just this time, it came in two odd flat halves.

Adjusting to the column staggered keys was fairly straigthforward. And that was it. From then on, the huge spacebars now looked nothing but barbaric. I almost regretted using the Filco for so long - eventhough I was perfectly happy with it. That's how much better a better layout can be.

But the real challenge was figuring out what to do with the 4 thumb keys and 10 layers. The potential was intimidating, but also time consuming. Given the freedom to do anything, what the hell?

Lesson one: **"Being told what to do is easy. Choice is what's hard."**

But I did have one issue with my Voyager. The keys just felt cheap. The only options were to replace the switches, or mod them, so I did both. I had feathery light "purpz" but with heavier red pros for where my fingers rest. The tape mod replaced the jittery clackiness with with a gentle thump.

But by that point, I just needed to know What a "good" keyboard sounded like. So I chose the Space65 featured on an asmr video that also came in an EVA colorway. I spotted one on the aftermarket, and that was it. The board was pre-built and as-is, and had it not sounded that good, I likely would not be typing this now.

The board was heftly, the finish was stunning, and the keys felt and sounded like popping bubblewrap. It didn't thock. It didn't clack. It popped.

Lesson two: **"Once you experience it, there is no going back."**

A good keyboard is like good coffee. There's only experiencing it, and once you do, the coffee you used to never complain about suddenly tastes like garbage.

And that is my Filco. I type on it now and it sounds... tragic.


# A Few Misconceptions

#### 1. "Smaller keyboards have less keys."

Physical keys, yes, but every new layer multplies the physical key count. So a 40% keyboard with 3 layers is a 120% keyboard.
   
#### 2. "Layers are difficult."

Shift is a layer, as are ctrl, alt, fn, and win, that just give another input for various keys. What's difficult is figuring out what to put on new layers, how to trigger them, how to remember it all, and what to do with combinations of mods and alternate layer input.
#### 3. "QWERTY is old, I should learn a new layout."

Yes, QWERTY is not the most efficient when considering key usage and travel distance. However, most of your wrist twisting and bad posture are not the result of how your alpha keys are laid out, which are all 1u distance from the homerow. 

And the results of the clinical trials conducted by "the internet" are fairly unanomous. After months of productivity loss as you switch, most end up slower than their speeds on QWERTY, which you'd think would be impossible given QWERTY is scientifically proven to be less efficient. This isn't to say you shouldn't do it. Just, do everything else first, especially if your primary concern is ergonomics.
