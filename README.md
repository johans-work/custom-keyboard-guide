# Some History

I started with the ZSA Voyager, and though the column staggered keys were not that big of an adjustment, figuring out the layers was. What do you even do with 4 thumb keys and 10 layers?

Lesson one: **"Being told what to do is easy. Choice is what's hard."**

Once you experience just how efficient and comfortable a smaller layout can be, large keyboards begin to feel barbaric. Why am I not using my thumbs more? Why is backspace and shift so far? 

21 years ago, I was at the keyboard section of Yodobashi Camera in Tokyo. I did my research and sought out the best sounding premium keyboard money could buy, and landed on a Filco with cherry brown switches. I used it for 20 years. 

Then this year, after I purchased a voyager, I wasn't so impressed with the sound and feel of the keys. So after some research, I got a Space65 mecha colorway on the aftermarket to match my newly built EVA PC. 




# A Few Misconceptions

#### 1. "Smaller keyboards have less keys."

Physical keys, yes, but every new layer multplies the physical key count. So a 40% keyboard with 3 layers is a 120% keyboard.
   
#### 2. "Layers are difficult."

Shift is a layer, as are ctrl, alt, fn, and win, that just give another input for various keys. What's difficult is figuring out what to put on new layers, how to trigger them, how to remember it all, and what to do with combinations of mods and alternate layer input.
#### 3. "QWERTY is old, I should learn a new layout."

Yes, QWERTY is not the most efficient when considering key usage and travel distance. However, most of your wrist twisting and bad posture are not the result of how your alpha keys are laid out, which are all 1u distance from the homerow. 

And the results of the clinical trials conducted by "the internet" are fairly unanomous. After months of productivity loss as you switch, most end up slower than their speeds on QWERTY, which you'd think would be impossible given QWERTY is scientifically proven to be less efficient. This isn't to say you shouldn't do it. Just, do everything else first, especially if your primary concern is ergonomics.
