# Intro
This is an overview of custom mechanical keyboards of all shapes and sizes for anyone starting or just interested in another enthusiast's take.

The 3 lessons custom keyboards could teach somebody:

1) being told what to do is easy
2) choice is hard
3) there's no going back

We will then cover some terminology, common misconceptions, simple recommendations, market landscape, and resources.

# Journey

In the early 2000s Tokyo. After days of testing keyboards on display at Yodobashi, I took home a stealth edition Filco sporting cherry brown switches. Reviews were raving, and little did I know I would go on to use the thing for the next 20 years. No issues. 

Fast foward to 2023. After building an Evangelion themed PC, I grabbed the matching top-of-the-line ASUS keyboard. A stunning, fully lit, marvel of engineering with raving reviewes, that matched my setup perfectly. By all measures, my full setup, including my keyboard, was now END GAME worthy. Except, the thing was too clicky, too loud, keys a bit too heavy, and left no room for my mouse. The ASUS would entertain my desk for another 6 months, but only for the light show, for I had met someone else. My ZSA Voyager.

Committed to upgrading, and being old enough to believe this could be my last chance to switch for health benefits, I arrived at the ZSA Voyager. Another fully lit marvel, backed by raving reviews, with plenty of room for my mouse, and even a beverage in the middle.

Adjusting to the column staggered keys was fairly straigthforward, but it was the thumb keys that did it. The huge spacebars now felt nothing but barbaric. It made me regret using my Filco for so long, eventhough I was perfectly happy with it. 

### Lesson one: **"Conforming is easy, and will even keep you happy."**

But the real challenge was figuring out what to do with the 4 thumb keys and 10 layers. The potential was intimidating, but also time consuming. Who knew the freedom to do anything could lead to so much suffering. It would take months to finally arrive at my [berserk layout](https://github.com/johans-work/berserk).

### Lesson two: **"Choice is hard."**

But I did have one issue with my Voyager. The keys just felt cheap. The only options were to replace the switches, or mod them, so I did both. I had feathery light "purpz" but with heavier red pros for where my fingers rest. The tape mod replaced the jittery clackiness with a muted thump. Much much better.

But by that point, I just had to know what a "good" keyboard sounded like. I came across the Space65 in an ASMR video, that also came in an Evangelion colorway. I eventually spotted one on the aftermarket. The board was as-is, pre-built by the previous owner, and that was the end of it. Had it not sounded that good, I likely would not be typing this, on my 40% cisne, now.

The board was heftly, the finish was stunning, and the keys felt and sounded like popping bubblewrap. It didn't thock or clack. It popped. My workspace turned inito ASMR space, and typing on it was delicious.

### Lesson three: **"Once you experience it, there is no going back."**

A good keyboard is like good coffee. There's no explaining it. There's only tasting it. But once you do, all that coffee you never complained about and even enjoyed, suddenly tastes like trash.

And that is my Filco. When I type on it now, it sounds... tragic. There is no going back. And just like coffee, I'm willing to invest my time and money into making that perfect cup.


# Some Terminology

#### 1u, 1.25u, 1.5u, etc.

#### homerow

#### dual function keys

#### QMK / VIA / VIAL

#### Interest Checks (ICs)

#### Group Buys (GBs)

#### GMK

#### ABS and PBS


# Common Misconceptions

### 1. "Smaller keyboards have less keys."

Physical keys, yes, but every new layer multplies the physical key count. So a 40% keyboard with 3 layers is a 120% keyboard.
   
### 2. "Layers are difficult."

Shift is a layer, as are ctrl, alt, fn, and win, that just give another input for various keys. What's difficult is figuring out what to put on new layers, how to trigger them, how to remember it all, and what to do with combinations of mods and alternate layer input.

What's also difficult is entering passwords with long random strings of symbols, but this isn't easy with any keyboard, and you should be using a password manager anyway.

### 3. "I need to switch from QWERTY."

Yes, QWERTY is not the most efficient when considering key usage and travel distance. However, most of your wrist twisting and bad posture are not the result of how your alpha keys are laid out, which are all 1u distance from the homerow, regardless of your layout.

And the results of the clinical trials conducted by "the internet" are fairly unanomous. After months of productivity loss as you switch, most end up slower than their speeds on QWERTY, which you'd think would be impossible given QWERTY is scientifically proven to be less efficient. This isn't to say you shouldn't do it. Just, do everything else first, especially if your primary concern is ergonomics.
